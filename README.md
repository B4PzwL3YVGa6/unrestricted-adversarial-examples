## Benchmarking your defense on Phase 1

To be evaluated against our Phase 1 attacks, your defense must do all of the following

- [ ] Accept batches of N images (passed into the constructor for the model)
- [ ] For each image return two scalar logits between [-inf, inf]. These correspond to the likelihood the image corresponds to each of the two classes (e.g., for TCU-Images, the bird and bicycle class)
- [ ] Maintain a throughput of at least 100 images per second when evaluated on a P100 GPU on TCU-Images, and XXXX images per second on TCU-MNIST

Your defense will be evaluated with the following mechanism
- A test dataset is passed through the model and converted to logits
- Confidence is defined as `max(bicycle_logit, bird_logit)` The 20% of images that resulted in logits with the lowest confidence are abstained on by the model and are discarded.
- The modelâ€™s score is the accuracy on points that were not abstained on.

Your defense will be evaluated on the following four datasets
- 1000 clean data points from TCU-images
- 1000 Linfinity-ball adversarial examples generated by SPSA
- 1000 spatial adversarial examples (via grid search)
- 100 L2-ball adversarial examples generated by [todo decide]
